==========================
Development on Github
==========================

Clawpack development is done using `Git <http://git-scm.com/>` for version
control.

There is an overarching Clawpack "Organization" on Github located at
`<https://github.com/clawpack>`_.  
Under this, there are now several separate repositories for moving forward
with Clawpack development. 

The 4.x line of Clawpack is in the repository `clawpack-4.x
<https://github.com/clawpack/clawpack-4.x>`_.  

If you want the latest version of Clawpack 4.x, you can clone this
repository:: 

    $ git clone git://github.com/clawpack/clawpack-4.x.git  /path/to/local/clawpack-4.x

With luck, Clawpack 4.x will soon be 
obsolete since work is well underway to upgrade to Clawpack 5.0.

For Clawpack 5.0 and beyond, there are separate repositories for each major
piece of Clawpack: classic, amrclaw, geoclaw, visclaw, util, etc.

See `<https://github.com/clawpack/doc/wiki>`_ for more about this, and about
plans for other changes.
