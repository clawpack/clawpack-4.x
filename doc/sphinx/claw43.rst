Clawpack 4.3 documentation
##########################


We are converting to  `Sphinx documentation <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_
starting with Clawpack 4.4. This Python based documentation system should
allow us to keep the documentation up to date with the code, incorporate
working examples, etc.


.. comment:
   A partially working sphinx version of the Clawpack 4.3 documentation is at

    * `<http://www.amath.washington.edu/~ketch/clawdoc/>`_

The original pdf version can be found at

 * `<http://www.clawpack.org/clawpack-4.3/doc.html>`_

.. warning::

   Many things have changed since Clawpack 4.3!
   See :ref:`changes`

To convert old applications to the new form, see :ref:`convert`.
