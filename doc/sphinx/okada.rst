Earthquake sources: Fault slip and the Okada model
=====================================================

To initiate a tsunami from an earthquake, it is necessary to generate a model of
how the seafloor moves, which is generally specified in a *dtopo* file as
described in :ref:`topo_dtopo`.

For historic earthquakes, it is generally possible to find many different
models for the distribution of slip on one or more fault planes, 
see for example the pointers at :ref:`tsunamidata_sources`.
