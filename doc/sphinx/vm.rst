=============================================================
Clawpack Virtual Machine 
=============================================================

Using Clawpack requires a variety of other software packages, as summarized in
:ref:`installing`. An alternative to installing the prerequisites is to use the
virtual machine described in this section.

Another alternative is to run Clawpack on the Cloud, see :ref:`aws`.

To do so, you need only download and
install the 
`VirtualBox <http://www.virtualbox.org/>`_
software and then `download  a Virtual Machine
<http://www.clawpack.org/VM>`_ (VM)
that has been built specifically for Clawpack.  VirtualBox will run this
machine, which will emulate a version of Ubuntu Linux that already has
installed all of the software packages needed.

See the `VirtualBox documentation <http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Documentation>`_
for more about VMs in general.

System requirements
-------------------

The VM is around 2.5 GB in size, uncompressed, and the virtual disk
image may expand to up to 8 GB, depending on how much data you store
in the VM.  Make sure you have enough free space available before
installing.  You can set how much RAM is available to the VM when
configuring it, but it is recommended that you give it at least 512
MB; since your computer must host your own operating system at the
same time, it is recommended that you have at least 1 GB of total RAM.

Setting up the VM in VirtualBox
-------------------------------

Once you have downloaded and uncompressed the virtual machine disk
image from `the download site <http://www.clawpack.org/VM>`_, 
you can set it up in VirtualBox, by doing the following:

#. Start VirtualBox

#. Click the *New* button near the upper-left corner

#. Click *Next* at the starting page

#. Enter a name for the VM (put in whatever you like); for *OS Type*,
   select "Linux", and for *Version*, select "Ubuntu".  Click *Next*.

#. Enter the amount of memory to give the VM, in megabytes.  Give it
   as much as you can spare; 512 MB is the recommended minimum.  Click *Next*.

#. Click *Use existing hard disk*, then click the folder icon next to
   the disk list.  In the Virtual Media Manager that appears, click
   *Add*, then select the virtual machine disk image you downloaded
   from the class web site.  Ignore the message about the recommended
   size of the boot disk, and leave the box labeled "Boot Hard Disk
   (Primary Master)" checked.  Once you have selected the disk image,
   click *Next*.

#. Review the summary VirtualBox gives you, then click *Finish*.  Your
   new virtual machine should appear on the left side of the VirtualBox
   window.

Optionally, if you have a reasonably new computer with a multi-core
processor and want to be able to run parallel programs across multiple
cores, you can tell VirtualBox to allow the VM to use additional
cores.  To do this, click the VM on the left side of the VirtualBox
window, then click *Settings*.  Under *System*, click the *Processor*
tab, then use the slider to set the number of processors the VM will
see.  Note that some older multi-core processors do not support the
necessary extensions for this, and on these machines you will only be
able to run the VM on a single core.

Starting the VM
---------------

Once you have configured the VM in VirtualBox, you can start it by
double-clicking it in the list of VM's on your system.  The virtual
machine will take a little time to start up; as it does, VirtualBox
will display a few messages explaining about mouse pointer and
keyboard capturing, which you should read.

After the VM has finished booting, it will present you with a login
screen; click the button in the center labeled "Clawpack User" to
log in as ``clawuser``.

The password is also ``clawuser``.  

Shutting down
-------------

Click the green running man in the lower left corner and then click
*"Shut Down"* to exit the VM.  You can also *"Suspend"*, which preserves
the memory state and is better if a long job is running in the VM
that you want to restart later where it left off.


Running programs
----------------

You can access the programs on the virtual machine through the main
menu (the mouse on an *X* symbol in the lower-left corner of the
screen), or by clicking the quick-launch icons next to the menu
button.  By default, you will have quick-launch icons for a terminal
window and a web browser.  After logging in for the first time, you should start
the web browser to make sure your network connection is working.

.. _vm_network:

Fixing networking issues
------------------------

Assuming your computer is connected to the internet, you should also be able to
access the internet from the VM.  This is necessary if you want to update
Clawpack using Git, or to transfer your results from the VM to the host
computer (or elsewhere) using sftp.

When a Linux VM is moved to a new computer, it sometimes doesn't
realize that the previous computer's network adaptor is no longer
available.  If you find yourself unable to connect to the Internet,
open a terminal window and type the following command::

 $ sudo rm /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules

This will remove the incorrect settings; Linux should then autodetect
and correctly configure the network interface it boots.  To reboot the
VM, click the running person icon in the bottom-right of the screen,
then click *Restart*.  

.. _vm_update:

Versions of Clawpack
--------------------

Starting with Version 4.6.0, the VM comes pre-installed with a specific
version of Clawpack and has a name such as VirtualClaw-4.6.0.
The directory containing Clawpack is then clawpack-4.6.0.

This approach has been chosen since previous versions of Clawpack are then
archived along with an operating system on which everything works.  This may
be advantageous is archiving codes that are used to produce the results in a
publication for example, where we recommend that you cite the version of
Clawpack used to obtain them.

Of course you are also welcome to install newer versions of Clawpack in a VM
for your own use if you choose to.  Git is also installed if you want to
clone the most recent version from Github, see :ref:`github`.

Using Clawpack on the VM
------------------------

See the file ``~/clawuser/README.txt`` for more about using Clawpack on the
VM.  The file ``~/clawuser/INSTALLED.txt`` has a list of some of the
software installed on the VM.


About the VM
------------

The virtual machine is running XUbuntu 9.10, a variant of Ubuntu
Linux (`<http://www.ubuntu.com>`_), which itself is an offshoot of
Debian GNU/Linux (`<http://www.debian.org>`_).  XUbuntu is a
stripped-down, simplified version of Ubuntu suitable for running on
smaller systems (or virtual machines); it runs the *xfce4* desktop
environment.

.. _vm_additions:

Guest Additions
---------------

These guest additions are already installed in VirtualClaw, so you should
not have to do the following...

Do the following so that the VM will automatically capture and uncapture
your mouse depending on whether you click in the VM window or outside it,
and to make it easier to resize the VM window to fit your display.


    1. Boot the VM, and log in.

    2. In the VirtualBox menu bar on your host system, select Devices -->
       Install Guest Additions...  (Note: click on the window for the class
       VM itself to get this menu, not on the main "Sun VirtualBox" window.)

    3. A CD drive should appear on the VM's desktop, along with a popup
       window.  (If it doesn't, see the additional instructions below.)
       Select "Allow Auto-Run" in the popup window.  Then enter the
       password you use to log in.

    4. The Guest Additions will begin to install, and a window will appear,
       displaying the progress of the installation.  When the installation is done,
       the window will tell you to press 'Enter' to close it.

    5. Right-click the CD drive on the desktop, and select 'Eject'.

    6. Restart the VM.

If step 3 doesn't work the first time, you might need to:

  Alternative Step 3:
    #. Reboot the VM.
    #. Mount the CD image by right-clicking the CD drive icon, and clicking
       'Mount'.
    #. Double click the CD image to open it.
    #. Double click 'autorun.sh'.
    #. Enter the VM password to install. 




Changing guest resolution/VM window size
----------------------------------------

This should not be necessary if the Guest Additions are working.

It's possible that the size of the VM's window may be too large for
your display; resizing it in the normal way will result in not all of
the VM desktop being displayed, which may not be the ideal way to
work.  Alternately, if you are working on a high-resolution display,
you may want to *increase* the size of the VM's desktop to take
advantage of it.  In either case, you can change the VM's display size
by going to the main menu in the lower-left corner, pointing to
*Settings*, then clicking *Display*.  Choose a resolution from the
drop-down list, then click *Apply*.

Setting the host key
--------------------

This should not be necessary if the Guest Additions are working.

When you click on the VM window, it will capture your mouse and future mouse
actions will apply to the windows in the VM.  To uncapture the mouse you
need to hit some control key, called the *host key*.  It should give you a
message about this.  If it says the host key is Right Control, for example,
that means the Control key on the right side of your keyboard (it does *not*
mean to click the right mouse button).

On some systems, the host key that transfers input focus between the
VM and the host operating system may be a key that you want to use in
the VM for other purposes.  To fix this, you can
change the host key in VirtualBox.  In the main VirtualBox window (not
the VM's window; in fact, the VM doesn't need to be running to do
this), go to the *File* menu, then click *Settings*.  Under *Input*,
click the box marked "Host Key", then press the key you want to use.
