New in Clawpack 5.0
##########################

Overview
--------

A few changes have been made that break backward compatibility.
These are discussed in more detail below.  A brief summary:

 * The directory structure has changed, so old Makefiles may not point to libraries
   properly.


Directory structure
-------------------

The directory structure of Clawpack has been modified to conform (slightly) better with 
standard conventions.  

In Version 4.4, the main directory was called `claw` and within this was a subdirectory
`clawpack` containing the classic single-grid Clawpack routines.  Parallel to this was a
subdirectory `amrclaw` with the AMR versions.

Starting in Version 4.5.0, the main directory is called `clawpack`. 
The location of this directory is where the environment variable `$CLAW` should point and
this convention will be used below.

The subdirectory `$CLAW/src` now contains:

 * `claw`:  The classic Clawpack source code, with subdirectories `Nd` for `N=1,2`
   containing the library routines (previously these routines were 
   in `claw/clawpack/Nd/lib`).

 * `amrclaw`: The AMR version (only the `2d` version has been ported at this time).

 * `geoclaw`: The GeoClaw code.  The subdirectory `2d` contains version of the
   `amrclaw` routines that have been modified for 2d depth-averaged flows.

The main directory also contains a subdirectory `$CLAW/lib` that will be used to store
dynamically linked libraries created from the source code.  For more details, see below.

New in Clawpack 4.5
##########################

.. _new_in_claw44:

New in Clawpack 4.4
##########################

Overview
--------

Clawpack 4.4 consists of the Fortran 77 files from Clawpack 4.3 together
with new Python tools for specifying input data and plotting results.

There is also a preliminary version of a pure Python version of Clawpack,
see :ref:`pyclaw`.


Summary of major changes
------------------------

  * The classic clawpack routines now read data from a file *claw.data*

  * rather than *clawNez.data* and the first line of this file lists the 
    number of space dimensions.   The remainder of the file has the same
    form as before.

  * Rather than modifying *claw.data* it is recommended that you modify
    parameters in the file *setrun.py* and then type 

      $ make .data

    to create the *claw.data* file.  You can modify this to also create
    *setplot.data* or other required data files.

  * The matlab plotting scripts should still work as described in the 4.3
    documentation, but there is now a Python option that uses only open
    source software and provides more powerful plotting tools.
    See :ref:`plotting`.

  * The output routines such as *out1.f*, *out2.f* in classic Clawpack and
    *valout.f* in AMRClaw have been slightly modified to also print ndim to
    the *fort.t* files.  This should not affect Matlab plotting but is
    needed for the new Python plotting routines.

Changes since 4.4.0
-------------------------

 * 10/30/09: Several more changes to Makefiles and amrclaw/2d/lib.

   * This version posted as claw4rev226.tar.gz

   * The subroutines filpatch and prefil are now written as recursive
     subroutines, so filpatch2.f, filpatch3.f, prefil2.f, and prefil3.f have
     been removed.  Also drawrg.f has been removed, an old NCAR graphics
     routine no longer used.  Makefiles in any amr application directory
     will need to be changed to remove these files from the list.

   * For some samples of how to use the latest amrclaw, see e.g.,
     
     * `$CLAW/clawpack/2d/example1/amr  <claw/clawpack/2d/example1/amr/README.html>`_ 
     * `$CLAW/apps/advection/2d/annulus/amr <claw/apps/advection/2d/annulus/amr/README.html>`_ 


 * 10/20/09: Several changes to Makefiles and amrclaw/2d/lib.

   * A new `$CLAW/apps <claw/apps>`_ directory has been added for
     applications.  The ones there now are ones used to debug the amrclaw
     changes, but eventually many more applications from Clawpack 4.3 and
     elsewhere will be put here.

   * New options added to the common Makefile in util/Makefile.common.
     Type "make help" for a list.  Makefiles can now also check for
     dependencies of included files such as call.i used in AMR.

   * New boundary conditions added to amrclaw for problems on the sphere,

   * Dynamic memory for amrclaw - the subroutine init_alloc.f95 was split up into:

    * init_alloc.f90   does initial allocation and the initial size of
      the work array for AMR is specified here.

    * resize_alloc.f90  reallocates for dynamic memory allocation if
      the code runs out of space for AMR.

    * resize_alloc_static.f90  halts with an error message instead of
      reallocating.  For use with compilers that don't support move_alloc,
      such as older versions of gfortran.  This is recommended as the 
      default version in application Makefiles since otherwise it might
      not compile.  Note that some f90 compatible compiler is required
      for using AMR (e.g. gfortran, which is freely available).

    * restart_alloc.f90 is needed when doing a restart with dynamic memory.

    * Note that .f95 files are now relabelled as .f90 since this is
      apparently the standard.

    * Note that Makefiles in user directories that use amrclaw
      will need to be updated to list init_alloc.f90 and
      resize_storage_static.f90 or resize_storage.f90.

   * Several bug fixes in amrclaw/2d/lib


 * 9/18/09: branches/rjl merged back into trunk, includes:

   * Improvements to plotting routines and documentation,

   * More converted examples in the book directory,

   * clawpack/2d/lib directory added with 2d single-grid routines.  

     Similar to version from Clawpack 4.3 but can use setrun.py to set
     runtime parameters and data file is now called claw.data.

     See clawpack/2d/example1 for an example of usage.

   * amrclaw/2d/lib directory added. 
   
     Similar to the version in Clawpack 4.3,
     but with some f95 routines to support dynamic memory allocation.  Also
     gauges are implemented in this version (documentation to appear).

     See clawpack/2d/example1/amr for an example of usage.
